            Each friend gets a row. Their posts flow into columns by type—up to 12 per category 
            before a new row is created. Scroll horizontally through their content, vertically 
            through your friends. Everything in chronological order. No engagement-bait reshuffling.
          </p>
          <p className="river-difference">
            <strong>Why it's different:</strong> Traditional feeds bury your friend's third post 
            under a stranger's viral video. Here, you see the full picture—grouped, organized, 
            and actually browsable. Your feed becomes a gallery, not a slot machine.

          <h2>Learning in Public</h2>
          <p>
            Numeneon was built as a learning project—and we're not hiding that. This isn't 
            a VC-backed startup with 50 engineers. It's a small crew teaching ourselves 
            React, Django, WebSockets, and real-time systems by actually building something.
          </p>
          <p>
            Every feature is documented. Every decision is explained. The codebase is open, 
            the process is transparent. We're students of the craft, and this is our workshop.
          </p>
          <p className="learning-philosophy">
            The best way to learn isn't tutorials—it's building something you actually care about 
            and figuring it out as you go. That's what Numeneon is.

          <h2>The Basement</h2>
          <p className="basement-intro">
            Below the neon-lit top floor of Numeneon lies something different. A hidden door. 
            A staircase down. The basement studio.
          </p>
          <p>
            Think of Numeneon as a building. The main app is the penthouse—clean lines, 
            cyber aesthetics, the River Timeline flowing through glass walls. But every 
            building has a basement.
          </p>
          <p>
            MyStudio is that basement. A private studio where your Top 8 
            friends hang out. Custom themes. Embedded music players. Sparkle cursors and 
            marquee text. All the chaotic self-expression that made early social media 
            actually personal.
          </p>

            <p>
              <strong>The Elevator:</strong> A dedicated search engine in the basement that 
              pulls friends down from the Numeneon top floor. Find your people, drag them 
              to your space, rank them in your Top 8. It's invitation-only—your basement, 
              your rules.

          <p className="basement-philosophy">
            Not everyone needs to see it. Not everyone will get it. That's the point. 
            Some spaces should be earned, not discovered by algorithm.

            This won't replace Instagram. But not everything needs a billion users 
            to be substantive.  But the best communities aren't the biggest — they're the ones where people actually show up.
          </p>
          <p>
            The design is loud. The cyber aesthetic isn't for everyone. Good. Neither are we.

## 🔐 Proprietary Components

The following **core algorithms and architectural systems** are proprietary intellectual property. While this repository demonstrates our engineering approach, certain critical components are maintained in a **separate private vault**:

### Smart Feed Algorithm

The "River Timeline" protocol includes proprietary logic for:

- **Intelligent Post Grouping** — How posts are organized into parallel streams
- **Overflow Splitting Logic** — The epoch-based chunking system
- **Engagement Scoring** — How content priority is determined

### Cognitive Orchestration Layer

The state management architecture includes:

- **Context Flow Optimization** — Performance-tuned data propagation
- **Real-time Sync Protocol** — WebSocket orchestration patterns
- **Predictive Pre-fetching** — User behavior anticipation logic

### Visual Intelligence System

Design system internals:

- **Dynamic Theme Generation** — The algorithm behind adaptive color schemes
- **Motion Choreography** — Animation timing and easing functions
- **Responsive Breakpoint Logic** — Context-aware layout decisions
